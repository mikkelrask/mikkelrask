- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikkelrask, im a hobby futurist, linux nerd, hardware hacker and tinkerer.
- 🖐️ I'm a hjkl-kinda guy
- 👀 I’m generally interested in all the geeky stuff, no matter if we're talking about self hosting different services, spinning up VMs, (de)soldering stuff or designing and making PCBs, keyboards or whatever.
- 🌱 I’m currently focussing on IoC, where i'm taking a deep dive into docker, kubernetes, ansible and other general DevOps'y stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything you think I can be useful for. If you have a project going on, and think I can be of any help at all, just let me know. 
- 📫 How to reach me - well, here's a great oportunity, otherwise you should be able to find other information on either raske.xyz or mikkelrask.github.io
