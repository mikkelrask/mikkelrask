- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikkelrask, and im a hobby futurist, hardware hacker and tinkerer.
- 🖐️ I'm a hjkl-kinda guy, using Arch btw...
- 👀 I’m generally interested in all the geeky stuff, no matter if we're talking about self hosting different services, stowing dotfiles, spinning up VMs, (de)soldering stuff or designing and making PCBs, keyboards or whatever.
- 🌱 I’m currently focussing on just about everything, where i'm especially taking a focussed deep dive into `all the things`.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything you think I can be useful for. If you have a project going on, and think I can be of any help at all, just let me know. 
- 📫 How to reach me - well, here's a great oportunity, otherwise you should be able to find other information on either raske.xyz or mikkelrask.github.io
